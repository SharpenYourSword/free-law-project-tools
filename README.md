Free Law Project Tools
======================
In this repository, you'll find tools that can be used with the Free Law Project initiatives, including the CourtListener and RECAP datasets. This is a community-driven, experimental repository, so there are no promises about the quality of what you'll find here. 

That said, knowing the people that play around with FLP data, there's a great chance that beautiful things will bloom here.

Data Sets
---------
CourtListener: https://www.courtlistener.com/api/  
RECAP: https://archive.org/details/usfederalcourts  

Contributing
------------
If you have code to contribute, simply send a pull request. Somebody with access will review and merge your code, and you'll be given access to the same in the future.

You can [chat about this stuff in our Slack chat room](https://join-flp-talk.herokuapp.com/).
