Courtlistener Tools
===================
In this repository, you'll find tools that can be used with the CourtListener datasets. This is a community-driven, experimental repository, so there are no promises about the quality of what you'll find here. That said, knowing the people that play around with CourtListener data, there's a great chance that beautiful things will bloom here.
